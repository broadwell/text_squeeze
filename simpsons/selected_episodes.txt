think youll be pleasantly surprised. hey dr j. i think what we have on our hands here is a classic case of what laymen refer to as fear of failure as a result bart is an underachiever and yet he seems to be how should i put this proud of it. hmmm. one of his problems may be his short attention span which can lead to. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. hmmm huh. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. hmmmm. no. every other student in the class has shown at least some form of improvement and yet you continue to struggle why is that. i dunno. okay okay why are we dancing around the obvious i know it you know it i am dumb okay dumb as a post do you think im happy about it. there there bart youre just a late bloomer. oh i wish it were that simple as shameful and as emotionally crippling as it may be im afraid my recommendation is for bart simpson to repeat the fourth grade. what you cant hold me back ill do better i promise. well maybe it would help him to be left back it wont be so bad bart. no i mean it you cant hold me back i swear im gonna do better look at my eyes see the sincerity see the conviction see the fear as god is my witness i can pass the fourth grade.

head of this gang. no i just stop by the club occasionally to read the complimentary newspaper. then who is the kingpin the capo de tuti capi. thats the guy. hey. forgive me don bartholomew. we tried to stop the kid but he wouldnt quit it was like he went crazy. prostitution loan sharking numbers the kid liked to wet his beak in everything. mr simpson youve been the boys father for ten years do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous criminal syndicate. well not the leader i mean oh its true its true all the pieces fit. in light of the damning testimony from your fellow gangsters your father your teachers and a seemingly endless parade of emotionally shattered baby-sitters this court has no choice but to. stop. principal skinner. i thought he was dead. i suppose youre all wondering where ive been it all started a week ago i was at my desk revising and updating the school dress codes when. i was suddenly confronted by a gang of toughs acting on behalf of one bart simpson or so they said. we really think theres promise in the boy. get out. okay okay you dont have to yell. to get my mind off that ugly confrontation i went home and began bundling my old newspapers but suddenly the pile fell i was trapped let this be a lesson to recycle frequently. for the next week i stayed alive by eating my mothers delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand i made a game of it seeing how many times i could bounce the ball in a day then trying to break that record occasionally the police arrived to search my home. find anything this time boys. nah no sign of him chief. princess opal. i see nothing here but im afraid its splitsville for delta burke and major dad. but they seemed so happy. i shouted until i was hoarse but they couldnt hear me. im in here. well lets go. okay chief. finally i realized if i was ever going to get out of there i would have to do it myself. i formed a crude rocket from a discarded cigar tube and remembering an experiment from my days as a fourth grade science teacher i concocted a fuel from baking soda and the juice of discarded lemon wedges. the rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide dragging behind it the end of a vacuum cleaner cord. i grabbed on to the vacuum cleaner pushed the cord retractor button and was on my way to freedom. and thats my courageous story. your honor the prosecution moves that principal skinners testimony be stricken from the record. denied case dismissed. your honor do i still get paid. hey bart i hope there are no hard feelings. get bent. i deserved that look i know we let you down but me and the boys we still think youve got a big future in racketeering and extortion. sorry fat tony i used to think your gang was cool but now i learned that crime doesnt pay. blood on the blackboard the bart simpson story starring richard chamberlain as principal skinner joe mantegna as fat tony jane seymour as the woman he loved and tvs doogie howser neil patrick harris as bart simpson. bart im scared lets get outta here. shaddup. where do you want it skinner. not smart. cool. hey when do we get the check for this. well they said they changed it just enough so they dont have to pay us. you know who the real crooks are those sleazy hollywood producers.

look we just want to make movies not kill things. aw all these new superheroes suck none of them can hold a candle to radioactive man. the only decent new one is radiation dude. nah hes just a cheap imitation of radioactive man. explain. the similarities are subtle but many for example radioactive man has his famous catchphrase up and atom - with atom spelled a-t-o-m in a delicious pun. go on. while radiation dude has a similar but lamer catchphrase up and lets go. so you kids fancy yourselves experts eh. well between us weve read all 814 issues of radioactive man. yeah and we both have the special limited edition issue where he and fallout boy get killed on every page. well i suppose you know then that hollywood is planning a feature film about radioactive man. i have got to do

why rainier wolfcastle should be the star i think we should bring back dirk richter kids will wanna see the original radioactive man. i keep telling you hes 73 years old and hes dead. granted but. besides we want to stay as far away from the campy 70s version as possible. billowing backpacks radioactive man its the worst villain of them all the scoutmaster. i see him fallout boy. go get em scouts. dont be afraid to use your nails boys. so where could we shoot this picture we need a city that has a nuclear reactor and a gorge and can guarantee us the full cooperation of city officials.

screen pretending to be a hero but youre not the real heroes are out there toiling day and night on more important things. television. no curing heart disease and wiping out world hunger. but milhouse they havent cured anything heart disease and world hunger are still rampant those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers every last one of them want results you have to go to the schwarzeneggers the stallones and to a lesser extent the van dammes. mickey rooney. hi milhouse the studio sent me to talk to you being a former child star myself and the number one box office draw from 1939 through 1940. wow spanning two decades. howd you find us. uh they tapped your treehouse phone. milhouse listen you cant quit this movie ive seen your work its good very very good van johnson good. i know im

radioactive man and you slick small towners took em for all they were worth. hurry mr rooney weve got a disenchanted little girl in a jell-o pudding commercial. i can play that. so milhouse it must be
