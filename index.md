Prior workshop: [Basic Web Scrapin' 101](https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/basic-web-scrapin-101)

## Save yourselves! Other text-analysis tools to consider
- [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) and its [panoply of plugins](http://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/tools). Seriously, there are tons of them.
- The compendium of tools at [TAPor3](http://tapor.ca/tools) (Text Analysis Portal) is a bit dated but still worth shopping through
- [Lexos](http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/upload)
- [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform) -- the best of the "graphical workflow" tools
- [LDA in the browser!](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/jsLDA/)
- [PhiloLogic5](https://github.com/ARTFL-Project/PhiloLogic5) for building and searching (including fuzzy search) large text corpora
